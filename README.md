# holadesk
========

Main holadesk code. It's the central component for the whole platform and it has two parts. The desktop and the framework for both the desktop and it's apps.

Computer desktops haven’t evolved enough since the invention of the GUI (Graphical User Interface). It’s mainly used to access your installed applications and quick access your files. But that’s too boring for something as magnificent as the desktop. With the recent development of the cloud and web technologies, we can do much much more.

In your desktop you have what you use the most. Thanks to our HTML5 apps platform, anyone can develop DeskApps of those web services you use everyday, and upload them to the holadesk Store. Just donwload those apps and have your personal web experience right in your desktop!
